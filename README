What is the PMViewer?
=====================
The PMViewer is a tool to read data.xml from the phpBB v3 private-message export.

Why PMViewer?
=============
Most phpBB 3.x.x boards limit the count of private-messages.
If a folder is full, you won't receive any more or old ones are overwritten.
But you are able to export the messages in e.g. xml-format.
If you do so, you just may save them in a folder, naming the files like you want.
NOW you can use the PMViewer to browse through and read your old messages.

INSTALL/USAGE
=============
1) Messages
	* On lunch the PMViewer fetches pm-data from the data/ folder. You can put your messages into that directory.
	* But you can open other folders during runtime from the menu "PMViewer" -> "Open folder", too.
2) Start
	* Start the PMViewer.jar ("java -jar PMViewer.jar").
	* On Windows you may double-click the PMViewer.jar .
3) Browse/read
	* You may filter your PMs in the Filter-View by selecting PMs in the table
	  and/or by using the filter-form.
	* You can sort the table by clicking on the column-headlines. 
	* Smile! :-)
