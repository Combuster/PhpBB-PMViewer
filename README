What is the PMViewer?
=====================
The PMViewer is a tool to read data.xml from the phpBB v3 private-message export.

Why PMViewer?
=============
Most phpBB 3.x.x boards limit the count of private-messages.
If a folder is full, you won't receive any more or old ones are overwritten.
But you are able to export the messages in e.g. xml-format.
If you do so, you just may save them in a folder, naming the files like you want.
NOW you can use the PMViewer to browse through and read your old messages.
